# Experemental-mod
A Mindustry mod where players take turns adding their own piece to the mod and then passing it on to others without any communication.

# Notes
The participants can edit all the files (and also this file), so if you want add the pictures here (for pictures you can dm me. i will add your picture in https://github.com/Lehanchic25/Pictures ([the same concept as 3Snake3 (creator of Sapphirium mod)](https://github.com/3Snake3/Sapphirium/))) or whatever you want. 

If you're confused by what I wrote above, please dm me. I'll explain it to you in more detail.

[Another idea (for the last participant) - make a number of included content]

## All information for the participants (copied from [discord](https://discord.gg/yWmPW9XRGe)): 
### From ace1020spawn:
everything works so that the person who will start is chosen, he has 3 days to do something. when these 3 days end, the project is transferred to another person for 3 days. this is repeated until the participants run out. The order is random

everything will work on github with copies of commits made by all participants

it is impossible to communicate and transfer ideas

all progress will be hidden until you have worked for 3 days, then you will have access to github and you can see what others are doing after you

after 3 days, the GitHub account expires (i mean access to contribute)

if you don't have time, then you can add days or change your order (for example, you were second, but you can't work the next 3 days, so you become 4th in the queue
